      "message": "This is not a good idea IMO, and reverting it and having to document the new host requirement to build meta-flutter related things would be preferable (or some other option, see below).  BitBake runs Python tasks internally with compile+exec, so they are run with the host Python.  That Python is not necessarily always going to be compatible with a module built with and for python3-native.\n\nIf you do want to drop the need for pyyaml on the host, then another approach would be to inherit python3native, have python3-pyyaml-native in DEPENDS, and then either use a one-liner \"python3 -c blah\" or emit a script and run in a shell task.  I think that would be not too bad if the only thing you are getting from pubspec.yaml is the application name to check against PUBSPEC_APPNAME, it could just be in separate a task that runs before do_compile.  Another perhaps less optimal option would be to maybe just use a \u0027^name:\u0027 regular expression to get the name...",
